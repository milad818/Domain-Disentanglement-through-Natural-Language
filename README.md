# Domain-Disentanglement-through-Natural-Language
The project aims to learn intrinsic representations of semantic concepts from captured images that can be generalized across domains. The task is quite challenging due to the presence of domain shift. In order to contribute to a better resolution of the problem, including ad-hoc language processing techniques can be highly beneficial.
